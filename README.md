# ChipSHOUTERâ„¢ Ballistic Gel

The CW521 is an Electro-Magnetic Fault Injection (EMFI) target. It is specially designed to help you understand fault injection patterns for a given tip.

It uses a large SRAM chip as a target, which has a relatively simple layout. This lets you understand how much of a given chip you are corrupting.

## GIT Layout

The GIT repository contains the following:

1) PCB gerber files.
2) Firmware for the microcontroller.

## PC Application

## Building Firmware

The firmware is built using Atmel Studio 7, but could also be built on Linux using an ARM toolchain.

## Legal
